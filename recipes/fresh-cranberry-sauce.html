            <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
            <p>Every November, Americans debate the merits of canned cranberry sauce vs. fresh 
            cranberry sauce. The canned sauce, with its signature shape and jiggly texture, is 
            certainly nostalgic. <strong>Fresh sauce</strong>, meanwhile, usually has a more complex flavor 
            (and a less gelatinous texture). Plus, when you make cranberry sauce from scratch, 
            you're able to customize the ingredients and ratios to suit your taste.</p>
            <p>It couldn't be easier to make this fresh cranberry sauce with just three ingredients. 
            You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below:</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="ingredients-list">1 cup water</li>
                <li class="ingredients-list">1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li class="ingredients-list">1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean Spray)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="steps-list">Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li class="steps-list">Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li class="steps-list">Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries 
                    have popped and sauce is chunky, about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The <strong>longer</strong> you cook 
                    it, the less chunky it will be.</li>
                <li class="steps-list">Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the pectin in the cranberries will 
                    make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.</li>
                <li class="steps-list">Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
            </ol>
