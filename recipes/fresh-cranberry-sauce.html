        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Every November, Americans debate the merits of canned cranberry sauce vs. fresh 
        cranberry sauce. The canned sauce, with its signature shape and jiggly texture, is 
        certainly nostalgic. <strong>Fresh sauce</strong>, meanwhile, usually has a more complex flavor 
        (and a less gelatinous texture). Plus, when you make cranberry sauce from scratch, 
        you're able to customize the ingredients and ratios to suit your taste.</p>

        <p>It couldn't be easier to make this fresh cranberry sauce with just three ingredients. 
        You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean Spray)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries 
                have popped and sauce is chunky, about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The <strong>longer</strong> you cook 
                it, the less chunky it will be.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the pectin in the cranberries will 
                make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.</li>
            <li>Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
        </ol>
