# odin-recipes
First project of the Odin Project

A little project about building a website for 3 recipes and a main page, each recipe having their own page.

This was done using only HTML and all the things i've learned on the HTML section, this inclues tags like:
p for paragraphs.
a for making both relative and absolute links.
img for putting images on the website.
ul for making unordered lists.
ol for making oredered lists.
li for putting the content on said lists
Both h1 and h2 for diverse titles
Both em and strong for different words or sections on the website

I first followed the step by step guide that appeared on the Curriculum, after i completed everything i added some other things like a related links section which contains link to TOP's main page on each page of the website and a link to the other recipes on the website, also link to the main page was added to each recipes's page on the website
